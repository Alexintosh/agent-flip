### Agent Flip

#### Inspiration
Sophisticated investors have evolving needs. An investor might be long WBTC when his thesis changes and he wants to go short. An investor might be long sBTC when one of his LPs tells him their fund contract requires collateralized rather than synthetic crypto investments. An investor might be holding cDai, earning interest until he's ready to get back into WBTC at a moment's notice.

There are *many* possible permutations. But today, an investor would have to visit several UIs and touch several protocols in order to reposition themselves accordingly.

#### What Agent Flip does
Agent Flip is a DeFi trading bridge between protocols. Our first supported asset is BTC. In one contract call, an investor can conveniently reposition, leveraging the power of five different trading protocols at once.

We use:

Kyber
Synthetix
Uniswap
Compound (WIP)
bZx (WIP)

Our first supported asset is BTC/WBTC.
